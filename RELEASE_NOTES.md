# Remote Developer Release Notes

## v1.2.0 - Web Interface Major Update (2025-06-06)

### üéâ Major Features

#### Web Interface Complete Rewrite
- **React Frontend Implementation**: Completely rewritten web interface using React for better state management and real-time updates
- **Real-time Log Streaming**: Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live task log streaming
- **Enhanced Task Dashboard**: Interactive task management with real-time status updates

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Toast Notifications**: Custom toast notification system for better user feedback
- **Form Data Persistence**: DevPod name, GitHub repo, and token are automatically saved in localStorage
- **Auto-log Display**: Task logs are shown by default for running tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Improved mobile and desktop layout with Tailwind CSS

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Code Organization
- **Project Restructuring**: Organized debugging and test files into proper directories
  - `debug/` - Debug scripts (manual_debug.sh, debug_clone.sh)
  - `test_scripts/` - Test files (test_api.py, test_claude_direct.py, etc.)
  - `examples/` - Alternative API server implementations
- **Main Server Runner**: Consolidated to `run_server.py` as the primary entry point

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Claude Execution Hanging**: Resolved heredoc syntax issues causing "EOF: command not found" errors by implementing base64 encoding
- **Resolved Template Conflicts**: Fixed Jinja2 template processing conflicting with React JSX syntax
- **SSE Connection Issues**: Fixed EventSource infinite loop and dependency array problems in React useEffect
- **Log Auto-scroll**: Disabled automatic scrolling for better user experience during log viewing

#### API Enhancements
- **CORS Support**: Added proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- **Static File Serving**: Changed from Jinja2 template rendering to static file serving for React compatibility
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error messages and status reporting

### üõ†Ô∏è Infrastructure Changes

#### Development Workflow
- **Improved Testing**: Enhanced test structure with proper file organization
- **Debug Tools**: Added comprehensive debugging scripts and manual testing capabilities
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README with new project structure and usage instructions

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient State Management**: Optimized React component re-rendering cycles
- **Memory Management**: Proper EventSource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Reduced Network Overhead**: Fixed infinite SSE request loops

### üîç Technical Details

#### React Implementation
- Custom toast notification component (replaced ReactToastify dependency)
- useEffect hooks for task lifecycle management
- EventSource API for real-time log streaming
- localStorage integration for form data persistence

#### Server-Side Events (SSE)
- `/api/task-logs/{taskId}/stream` endpoint for real-time log streaming
- JSON-formatted event data with completion status
- Proper connection lifecycle management

#### Code Quality
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Proper component cleanup and memory management
- Consistent code organization and naming conventions

### üìã Breaking Changes
- Web interface now requires JavaScript enabled
- Changed from Jinja2 templates to React frontend
- Some API response formats may have changed for better React integration

### üéØ Next Steps
- Consider adding user authentication
- Implement task filtering and search functionality
- Add export capabilities for task logs
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
